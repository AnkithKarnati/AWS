# How to Unmount EBS volume of EC2 Linux Instance
Hi All,
 
In this blog will explain how we can unmount volume in Linux Instance

I am assuming that you have a running Linux EC2 instance on AWS  we want to unmount particular volume in our Linux EC2 instance.

Then login to EC2 instance with root privileges 

# Follow below commands
To check volumes
```
df -h
```
To list all the block devices in the Linux machine
```
lsblk
```
Run cmd to unmount the extra volume
```
unmount /dev/xvdf 
```
Then go to the EC2 Service under volumes select the extra volume and detach that volume thatâ€™s it done.

check again whether it is detach or not in Linux machine by running cmd
```
lsblk
```
